FilterItForMe is a tiny add-on for the web browser Mozilla Firefox (Version 142 and newer)

The Internet is filled with trash and FilterItForMe helps you filter unwanted content from websites.
Simply add terms to a filter list via context menu and next time the browser loads a webpage it removes all sections containing anything from the filter list.

Warning: 
This add-on is still in development. If you encounter bugs, please let me know!
